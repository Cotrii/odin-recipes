        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A very basic French toast recipe with cocoa in the egg mixture.
             I regularly serve it at our B&B and get rave reviews. 
             It's great served with cherry pie filling and syrup. We prefer using homemade bread.

            <li>Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture until well soaked, about 20 seconds per side. 
                Place in pan, and cook on both sides until they are no longer gooey or shiny in the middle when cut in half, 
                about 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
