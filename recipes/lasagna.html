        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A vegtable lasagna recipe made by heart from a woman to his picky husband (HAHA!). 
            A tasty "healthy" vegtable snack that mainly needs fresh mushrooms,
            bell pepper, onions, and of course 2 jars of pasta sauce. Don't forget to add 
            your favorite cheese, may it be mozzarella or parmesan, or even both!
        </p>

        <p>It is cooked for 1 hr and an additional 15 minutes with preparation time of
            25 minutes that could feed up to 12 servings which makes the total of 1 hour and 40 minutes
            to be spent for this dish.</p>
